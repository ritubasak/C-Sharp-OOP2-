PROJECT NAME: CAREER OPORTUNITY

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:

In this project we are mainly trying to build an online platform for Companies and Job Seekers of Bangladesh. 
From our built in project, both companies and job seekers will get the best facilities as their needs.
In Bangladesh at present, many job seekers are unemployed because of finding the best and suitable job for them. 
They often find the job in outside of our country. They think that doing job outside of country is more better and 
perfect than doing job in Bangladesh. But for the lack of knowledge of job marketing site,
they actually do not realize that Bangladesh also have the best job platform for them. 
So, from our job market site, they can find easily the best job for them. On the other hand, Companies will also be benefited. 
They can hire the best and experienced employee for their industry. None will be unemployed. 
Every job seeker will get the perfect job for him/her as per as his /her education and skills.
Hence, it is an essential platform to find a perfect job that appeals to the person with the right education and experience, 
according to that company.
